# Horizon Forbidden West Gameplay Tweaks & Cheat Menu

Source code for the Horizon Forbidden West mod, with a complete Simplified Chinese interface and localized configuration resources.

## Simplified Chinese localization

- Translates the gameplay, cheats, miscellaneous, entity spawner, inventory, weather, and log interfaces.
- Loads a CJK-capable font so Chinese text renders correctly in Dear ImGui.
- Includes localized `mod_config.ini` and `mod_DamageSettings.ini` resources without changing the original cheat defaults.
- Uses the Microsoft YaHei Bold font (`C:/Windows/Fonts/msyhbd.ttc`) at a large resolution-aware size by default. `DebugMenuFontPath`, `DebugMenuFontSize`, and `DebugMenuFontScale` can be changed under `[General]`.
- Replaces the narrow menu bar with a GTA-style interaction menu using hierarchical pages, keyboard navigation, mouse support, descriptions, and page counters.
- Uses the Windows hardware cursor by default so the pointer remains smooth when frame generation is enabled. Set `DebugMenuUseHardwareCursor = false` to restore Dear ImGui's software cursor.

## Menu controls

- Press the configured debug-menu hotkey (`Insert` by default) to open or close the menu.
- Use the arrow keys or `WASD` to select and adjust options.
- Press `Enter` to activate an option, `Backspace` or `Escape` to return, or use the mouse.
- The internal player-faction identifiers intentionally remain in English because they are game resource names rather than display text.

## Installation

- For developers, edit `CMakeUserEnvVars.json` and set `GAME_ROOT_DIRECTORY` to Horizon's root directory. The build script will automatically copy library files to the game folder.

- For manual Steam installs, copy `winhttp.dll`, `mod_config.ini`, and `mod_DamageSettings.ini` to the game's root folder. An example path is: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition\`.
